Training a muscle twice a week seems to provide better muscle growth compared to once a week. There is a slight advantage in frequency when the total volume is spread out over more sessions, with two times a week being the optimal minimum for most people.

Instead of cramming too many sets into one workout, it's better to spread your volume over more sessions to avoid diminishing returns. For example, doing 12 sets per week over three sessions (four sets per session) is more effective than doing 12 sets in two sessions (six sets per session).

For muscles you're focusing on, or if you're doing high volumes (20–30 sets per week), you can benefit from training those muscles more frequently, such as 3–4 times per week, especially if you're aiming to optimize growth.

If you're training 2–3 days a week, full-body workouts are most efficient, allowing you to train each muscle group twice a week. If you're training 4–5 days a week, an upper-lower split can work, but full-body sessions can still be effective.

The push-pull-legs routine works best for people who train 6+ days a week. Otherwise, you're missing out on the opportunity to train each muscle twice a week.

Around 5–8 direct sets per muscle per session is considered optimal for hypertrophy. When you start doing more than this in one session, diminishing returns set in, so it's better to add more days instead of overloading a single workout.

Exercises like rows or pull-ups indirectly work muscles (e.g., biceps during back training), which can help increase the frequency of training without needing extra isolation exercises. This indirect training still counts toward hypertrophy gains.
