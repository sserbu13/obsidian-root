Basic thought process when programming:

1. Task subdivision. Break up big problems into smaller ones until they are all small enough that you can do them. I want to make a Pac-Man clone. I need to render the screen, make walls, make the player, make food items, and enemies. How do I make enemies? I need to make them move, and hurt the player. How do I make them move? I need to make them move in a straight line, sense where walls are, turn random directions at intersections, and wrap around the edges of the screen.
    
2. Solutions. What is the first way that comes to mind to do each task? I approach this like I approach a hard math problem. Look at specific cases first and see what I can learn from those, and then gradually build up to the whole problem.
    
3. Optimization. Before, during and after coding, I think about if there are any places where my way of doing things is inefficient. The easiest ways to spot these places are to look for spots where there is redundant work being done, redundant data being stored, or tasks that are relatively slow for the computer but relatively fast in your head, because if thatâ€™s the case, maybe the algorithm youâ€™re using in your head is better than the one you wrote for the program.
    
4. Documentation. I do this always while Iâ€™m coding because my brain can only hold so much of the problem inside it at once. It can feel slow at first to write comments and docstrings for every single bit of code, but it will save far larger amounts of time later when you routinely need to remind yourself how another part of your program works.
